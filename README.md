# DriverPass
DriverPass class project

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?**

The client for the DriverPass project was Liam. He wanted me to design a system where students that were learning how to drive could reserve driving lessons
with an instructor. The system would allow a student to create an account and reserve driving lessons to practice for the driving exam.
The system would also provide students with different packages they could choose from that offered a varying number of driving sessions, one package offering additional
study material to help prepare them for the exam. Overall, I think I did a good job at identifying the different use cases for different users and satisyfing the necessary requirements
based on the client's needs.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would improve the diagrams to improve clarity by adding more details to avoid any ambiguities that may be present. For example, on the sequence diagram for reserving a driving lesson, I
would include more details concerning the loop that occurs when an instructor is not available and the steps that need to take place to ensure a student can reserve a lesson for another date
and time.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I was able to address the needs of the user to make sure the system was useful for them. Ultimately, a system is only as good as its utility. If the system meets the needs of users, then it
is considered a success. A system can be robust and may be rich with features, but if those features are not useful for the target user, then the system may as well not exist.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I always start designing software at a high level. I gather the needs of the typical user and conceptualize a system that meets these needs. This stage provides an overview, there is no code
at this point. I try to come up with as many use cases and anticipate possible behaviors by the user in each use case. I also try to identify any tricky edge cases that may occur. The design process
is all abstraction, i.e., there is no code, not even pseudocode at this point. The whole point is to make sure the system aligns with the business logic which is paramount for the success of the system.
